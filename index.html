        <p>In looking through the collection, two pieces initially
        caught my immediate attention: <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/223405">"Jocular Sounds"</a> (1929)
        by Wassily Kandinsky and the <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/217377?position=6">"Table Lamp"</a>
        (1924) by Wilhelm Wagenfeld and Carl Jacob Jucker.</a></p>

        <p>What I was most intrigued by was a sense of order and completeness each piece seemed to emulate.
        In musing over this a little more (and trying to decide which one to choose!), the question I
        found myself coming back to was how the various elements within each related to one another and in turn
        served to contribute to that sense of wholeness I perceived, and then for the purpose of this project how
        to express that visually on the screen.</p>

        <p>With that challenge in mind, I enthusiastically set out to sketch the lamp. However my attempt soon drifted from
        quasi-inspired to a bit haphazard to dull. And the lamp simply looked like the lamp (to an extent!)
        just sitting there on a table. Very exciting and original.</p>

        <p>Feeling distressed, SOMEHOW I needed to bring this thing to life! While perhaps seemingly basic observations,
        the concepts that a lamp does turn on and off and that objects look differently at night versus the day,
        led me to test out some animations. It was a start. There was hope.</p>

        <p>And the fish? They were a bit of an afterthought. While I had overlooked <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/225520?position=27">”Fish”</a>
        by Joan Stack at first, I was looking for something else to pull this project together. The color
        palette was fun; the diamonds a unique shape to play with; and the fish, well... truth be told,
        I find them a rather enigmatic and kind of creepy... but perfect candidates for animations as well.</p>

        <p>So that is how this piece all came to be. It was a bit of a creative headache, but in the end I had fun
        with it. On the technical side, some the animations were definitely a bit challenging-—especially when
        shifting the backgrounds and adding new elements to the piece I had not planned on. This entailed in having to
        continually reevaluate the order in which elements were drawn and to recognize that some of the code had (has)
        to be superfluous. I look forward to learning more about ways to approach this in the next few weeks!</p>

        <p>A few hints about the animations, as they may not be obvious (something else to work on!): the lamp and the fish
        are good things to explore with the mouse... and if you click on the fish on the table, the lights will come back on!</p>
