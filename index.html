    <div id='description'><p>In looking through the collection, two pieces initially caught my immediate attention:
    <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/223405">"Jocular Sounds"</a> (1929) by Wassily Kandinsky
    and the <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/217377?position=6">"Table Lamp"</a> (1924) by Wilhelm
    Wagenfeld and Carl Jacob Jucker.
    </a></p>

    <p>What drew me to both was a sense of completeness there seemed to be to each piece.
    Yet underlying that, the question I found myself coming back to was how the various
    elements within each related to one another and in turn served to contribute to that
    sense of wholeness I perceived—and then how to express that visually on the screen.</p>

    <p>With that in mind, my process of sketching the elements however soon drifted from
    inspired to a bit haphazard to dull. And the lamp simply looked like the
    lamp (to an extent!), just on a table. So that was that. But SOMEHOW I needed to bring this thing to life!

    <p>The basic observance that a lamp after all does turn on and off, and objects look differently
    at night versus the day, led me to play around with that concept.
    And the fish, well… they were a bit of an afterthought. While I had overlooked
    <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/225520?position=27">”Fish”</a>
    by Joan Stack at first, what I liked about it was that they were creatures that could be animated,
    and the diamonds were fun as well. I also have a bit of distrust of fish, and find them
    cool but creepy!</p>

    <p>On the technical side, some the animations were a bit challenging-—especially when shifting the
    backgrounds and adding new elements to the piece I had not planned on, which entailed having to
    reevaluate the order in which elements were drawn and to feel that some of the code had (has) to
    be superfluous. The other thing too, is that I hope the animations are evident! I look forward to learning more about ways to approach this in the next few weeks!</p>
